# Luxury Housing Sales Analysis - Bengaluru

This project analyzes luxury housing sales in Bengaluru using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**. It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, database insertion, and interactive dashboard creation for insights on market trends, builder performance, and buyer behavior.

---

## 🐍 Step 1: Python — Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Load the raw `.csv` file containing property transactions.
- Clean inconsistent formats (e.g., `Ticket_Price_Cr`).
- Handle null values in columns like `Amenity_Score` and `Booking_Status`.
- Normalize text fields (`Builder`, `Micro_Market`, etc.).
- Derive additional columns:
  - `Price_per_Sqft`
  - `Quarter_Number`
  - `Booking_Flag`
- **Output:** Cleaned CSV or DataFrame ready for database insertion.

---

## 🧠 Step 2: SQL — Load Clean Data into RDBMS
- Create appropriate SQL table schema for `property_transactions`.
- Insert cleaned data into **MySQL/PostgreSQL** using Python (`SQLAlchemy` or `pymysql`).
- Run initial SQL validation queries:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM property_transactions;
  SELECT Booking_Status, COUNT(*) FROM property_transactions GROUP BY Booking_Status;
  SELECT Developer_Name, AVG(Ticket_Price_Cr) FROM property_transactions GROUP BY Developer_Name;
  
📊 Step 3: Power BI — Visualize via Direct SQL Connection
Connect Power BI to the SQL database.
Build relationships and DAX calculations.
Create interactive dashboards:
Filters by Builder, Quarter, Micro_Market
Map visuals
Booking conversion KPIs
Insights from Buyer_Comments
